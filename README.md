Decibel SDK
===

The Decibel Java SDK makes it simple to query the Decibel API and deal with the results returned.

Calls to the Decibel API are made through query objects, which take care of all the logic involved in running a REST query, including deserializing the results to handy result objects. These can then be used to easily integrate Decibel data into your own application

For instructions on how to use the Java SDK, please visit: [https://developer.decibel.net/java-sdk](https://developer.decibel.net/java-sdk)

You will to sign up for a [Decibel API key](https://developer.decibel.net/signup) before running queries with the SDK
